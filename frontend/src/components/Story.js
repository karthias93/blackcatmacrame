                          <p className='about_me_para'><span className='greetings'>This is my journey.</span>
                            Macrame first caught my attention while I was adjusting to life abroad . I learned all the basic knots from my mother-in-law, who is also quite crafty, but I wanted to learn more intricate designs and learn more about macrame. And that's when I started watching YouTube tutorials. As I perfected all the basic skills, I started to hone my craft and create my own style of design.</p>
                          <p className='about_me_para'>My unique style and years of experience have allowed me to perfect my craft. My macrame journey is ever-continuous. As long as my hands let me, I‚Äôm determined to keep pushing forward and I'm excited to create more and more amazing pieces of art. Making macrame inspires me and brings joy to my life.</p>
                          <p className='about_me_para'>Making art out of strings is a very fulfilling experience for me. Despite whatever challenges life throws at me, I am confident that I can sit down, pick up some strings, and build something of value. I believe that my creations are beautiful, distinctive, and hopefully inspirational.
                              Each one is made with love and gratitude. Please accept my sincere thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy my creations.</p>
